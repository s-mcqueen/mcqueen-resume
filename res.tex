\section{EXPERIENCE}

{\sl Software Engineer} \hfill January 2014 - May 2016 \\
\href{http://www.nextdoor.com}{Nextdoor}, San Francisco, CA \\
Nextdoor is a social platform for neighbors. I joined the company as the 25th engineer.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt % Reduce space between items
\item Joined the ads team as the second engineer and helped the company make its first dollar. Implemented the first ads selection algorithm at Nextdoor. Built and enhanced tools to support advertising sales. Helped build our initial iOS advertising product.
\item Led iOS development of Nextdoor Babysitting -- an early prototype of a neighbor-to-neighbor services product. Worked with a team of 2 other iOS engineers over a 4 month period. \href{https://github.com/Nextdoor/NDPhraseParser}{Open-sourced} a small Objective-C library for string formatting that was needed.
\item Developed our 2015 engineering intern program. Interviewed dozens of intern candidates during the hiring process. Ran an onboarding process for interns that included talks by key employees.
\item Led a cross-platform team of 7 engineers (web, iOS \& Android) to build the 2014 Holiday Cheer Map, a neighbor-sourced map of holiday related points of interest. Worked with designers and product manager to spec the feature and plan for launch. Responsible for negotiating and then hitting aggressive development deadlines. Increased user sign-up during the slow holiday season by 16,000 users.
\item Implemented multiple photo uploading and viewing for neighbor posts on iOS and the web. Handled limited server thread capacity by uploading photos directly to AWS S3. Increased number of photo posts by neighbors by over 100\% and number of photos on the platform by over 500\%.
\end{itemize}

{\sl Software Engineering Intern} \hfill Summer 2013 \\
\href{http://www.nextdoor.com}{Nextdoor}, San Francisco, CA
\begin{itemize}
\item Joined the infrastructure team and helped write the client library to a backend newsfeed content service. The new service was multi-threaded and stateless, giving us horizontal scalability that reduced server costs and allowed us to optimize our newsfeed load times, leading to a 2X speed up on our most important pages.
\end{itemize}

\href{http://cmcforum.com/}{CMC Forum}, Claremont, CA
