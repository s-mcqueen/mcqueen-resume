\section{EXPERIENCE}

{\sl Software Engineer} \hfill January 2014 - May 2016 \\
\href{http://www.nextdoor.com}{Nextdoor}, San Francisco, CA \\
Nextdoor is a social platform for neighbors. I joined the company as the 25th engineer.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % Reduce space between items
\item Learned Objective-C and the iOS platform while on a deadline to ship code: implemented multiple photo uploading and viewing for neighbor posts on iOS and the web. Handled limited server thread capacity by uploading photos directly to AWS S3. Increased number of photo posts by neighbors by over 100\% and number of photos on the platform by over 500\%.
\item Led a cross-platform team of 7 engineers (web, iOS \& Android) to build the 2014 Holiday Cheer Map, a neighbor-sourced map of holiday related points of interest. Worked with designers and product manager to spec the feature and plan for launch. Responsible for negotiating and then hitting aggressive development deadlines. Increased user sign-up during the slow holiday season by 16,000 users.
\item Led iOS development of Nextdoor Babysitting -- an early prototype of a neighbor-to-neighbor services product -- with a team of 2 other iOS engineers over a 4 month period.
\item Developed our 2015 Engineering Intern program. Interviewed dozens of intern candidates during the hiring process. Ran an onboarding process for interns that included talks by key employees. Helped plan social events including lunch talks with Nextdoor executives and founders.
\item Refactored Ads backend to increase developer productivity. Helped build the initial iOS advertising product at Nextdoor.
\end{itemize}

{\sl Software Engineering Intern} \hfill Summer 2013 \\
\href{http://www.nextdoor.com}{Nextdoor}, San Francisco, CA
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % Reduce space between items
\item Joined the Infrastructure team and helped write the client library to a backend newsfeed content service. The new service was multi-threaded and stateless, giving us horizontal scalability that reduced server costs and allowed us to optimize our newsfeed load times, leading to a 2X speed up on our most important pages.
\end{itemize}

{\sl Managing Editor} \hfill March 2012 - March 2013 \\
\href{http://cmcforum.com/}{CMC Forum}, Claremont, CA
\begin{itemize}
\item Worked with Editor in Chief to manage a staff of 30 for a daily online publication with 30,000 pageviews a month. Managed a publishing schedule, a team of editors and the site's social media presence.
\end{itemize}

{\sl Product Management Intern} \hfill Summer 2012 \\
\href{https://www.atlassian.com/}{Atlassian}, Sydney, Australia
